PeepSo is the next-generation of Social Networking solution for WordPress.

== Description ==

PeepSo is an application that provides Social Networking features for your web site. PeepSo allows site users to create profiles, post to their activity stream and interact with other members. 

PeepSo core is a free plugin which possibilities can be extended by a number of supporting plugins developed and maintained by the same team that brought you PeepSo.

=FriendSo=
This plugin allows friend connections between users. Also introduces a new privacy level ‘Friends Only’ which allows to share information only with friends and not entire community.

This plugin works alongside FriendSo and allows you to tag your friends in status updates. Also allows to tag people in comments, who are not necessarily friends but you’d like to get their attention.

=MsgSo=
This plugin gives users the option to send private messages between themselves. Messages can be sent to friends, non friends, you can also have a group conversation. 

=LocSo=
This is a location plugin that you can use to attach location to your posts in the community.

=PicSo= 
This plugin allows to share photos on the stream. Also adds photo wall to users’ profiles.

=VidSo=
This plugin allows to share videos from the most popular providers on the stream. It too creates a wall of videos in the users’ profiles.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I run PeepSo on my host? =

Probably yes. To help with this, we have created a separate plugin that you can install and run that will test your host to see if it meets all of the requirements. You can find this plugin at: http://wordpress.org/plugins/peepso-check/

= Can I use my existing theme? =

Yes! PeepSo was designed from the beginning to be used with your existing theme and does not require a theme designed to work with PeepSo. We have tested PeepSo with several themes and Frameworks already but your theme may require some customization. You can do this by copying template files into a `peepso/` directory within your theme folder and modifying them. Please see our guide at http://www.peepso.com/customizing-peepso-for-your-theme/ for more information on customizing PeepSo.

Yes! We have done lots of testing to ensure that PeepSo can run on MultiSite installs.
